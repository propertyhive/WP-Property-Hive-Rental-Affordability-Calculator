Quickly and easily add a rental affordability calculator to your website.

== Description ==

This plugin, from the creators of [Property Hive](https://wordpress.org/plugins/propertyhive/), allows you to quickly and easily add a rental affordability calculator to your website by simply adding the shortcode [rental_affordability_calculator] where you want it to appear.

Users simply enter the rent or annual income and the affordable rent and/or required salaries of both of both tenant and guarantor is calculated.

Note: This plugin is independent of Property Hive. You DO NOT need to be using Property Hive to download and use this plugin.
